'''
Recursively generates the permutations of a set length of lower case letters (eg. 2 => aa ab ba bb).
Writes the output to a file. BE AWARE THIS CODE GENERATES REALLY LARGE FILES REALLY QUICKLY, SO DON'T PUT IN A NUMBER LARGER THAN 5 OR SO UNLESS YOU HAVE THE SPACE (which you don't) TO STORE IT.
